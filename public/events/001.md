# UNAUX Transport Carrier John Henry // 2.21.5014u
The deck rumbles beneath your feet, and for the
first time you hear the howl of wind shear as the
autoshuttle breaches Hercynia’s thick atmosphere.
Seen through a condensation-streaked porthole,
the world below is an emerald smear, scarred by
ragged tears of black and brown. Patches of gray
cloud cover speak to the months-long rainstorms
that plague the surface.

“Thirty minutes out.” The flightcom’s voice in your
ear, unaffected by the turbulence, comfortable back
aboard the ship. “Leave your helms on for now,
cabin’s not pressurized. And you’re going through a
helluva lot of chop – don’t want to bang your head
on something before we get you to the ground.”
His radio clips off. The cabin lights flicker from an
especially hard knock, then the wind shear dies
down, and the howling engines settle to a level
cruising roar. The hiss of air through your helmet
subsumes all other sounds.

Below, emerald Hercynia.

Below – somewhere below – the mildewed halls of
ancient Egregorian hives lie dormant. Waiting. Empty.
